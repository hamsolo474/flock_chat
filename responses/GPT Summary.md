### Summary of Responses

The responses address an SQL error related to the variable `@table_name_col`, which is not recognized in the context where it is being used. The main points include:

1. **Error Identification**: The error arises because `@table_name_col` is not properly recognized within the dynamic SQL context, often due to scope issues.

2. **Correct Declaration**: The variable `@table_name_col` should be declared before it is used in the SQL script. It is correctly declared in the provided code, but its usage in dynamic SQL needs careful handling.

3. **Cursor Usage**: A cursor is used to iterate over table names, and the SQL string is constructed within a loop. The variable must be concatenated correctly into the SQL string.

4. **Revised Code Suggestions**:
   - Ensure `@table_name_col` is declared before the cursor loop and used correctly in the dynamic SQL.
   - Use `QUOTENAME` to safely include the variable in the SQL string, preventing SQL injection.
   - Consider executing the dynamic SQL within the loop to maintain scope.

5. **Additional Considerations**: 
   - Ensure database accessibility and permissions for the insert operation.
   - Be cautious of SQL injection vulnerabilities and consider using parameterized queries for better security.

### Examples of Corrected Code

Hereâ€™s an example of the corrected SQL code based on the suggestions:

```sql
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX) = '';
DECLARE @table_name_col NVARCHAR(255);
DECLARE table_insert CURSOR FOR
SELECT TABLE_NAME
FROM WM7HIST.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_NAME LIKE 'DATOS_SRV_%_%_00' OR TABLE_NAME LIKE 'DATOS_LSRV_%_%_00' OR TABLE_NAME LIKE 'DATOS_VSRV_%_%_00' OR TABLE_NAME LIKE 'DATOS_WKS_%_%_00';
OPEN table_insert;
FETCH NEXT FROM table_insert INTO @table_name_col;
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    SET @sql = @sql + '
        INSERT INTO DataWareHouse.dbo.Compliance (DEVICE_ID, ID_DATE, VALUE_TYPE, VALUE_ORIGINAL, ID_DATE_START, CPU_VALUES, MEMORY_VALUES, STORAGE_VALUES, AVALIABILTY )
        SELECT
            IDENTIF AS DEVICE_ID,
            FECHA as ID_DATE, VBLE_MODIFICADA as VALUE_TYPE, VALOR_VBLE as VALUE_ORIGINAL, FECHA_INSERT as ID_DATE_START,
            MAX(CASE WHEN VBLE_MODIFICADA LIKE ''%CPU%'' THEN VALOR_VBLE ELSE NULL END) AS CPU_VALUES,
            MAX(CASE WHEN VBLE_MODIFICADA LIKE ''%Memory%'' THEN VALOR_VBLE ELSE NULL END) AS MEMORY_VALUES,
            MAX(CASE WHEN VBLE_MODIFICADA LIKE ''%DiskUtilization%'' THEN VALOR_VBLE ELSE NULL END) AS STORAGE_VALUES,
            MAX(CASE WHEN VBLE_MODIFICADA LIKE ''STATE'' THEN VALOR_VBLE ELSE NULL END) AS AVALIABILTY
        FROM WM7HIST.dbo.' + QUOTENAME(@table_name_col) + '
        GROUP BY IDENTIF, FECHA, VBLE_MODIFICADA, VALOR_VBLE, FECHA_INSERT;';

    FETCH NEXT FROM table_insert INTO @table_name_col;
END
CLOSE table_insert;
DEALLOCATE table_insert;

-- Execute the dynamic SQL
EXEC sp_executesql @sql;
```

### Key Changes Explained
- **Dynamic SQL Execution**: The `EXEC sp_executesql @sql;` is called after the cursor loop, ensuring that the SQL string is built correctly.
- **Variable Scope**: The variable `@table_name_col` is correctly used within the cursor loop, and its value is concatenated into the `@sql` string for each iteration.
- **Safety Measures**: Using `QUOTENAME` helps prevent SQL injection by safely quoting the table name. 

This approach ensures that the variable is properly declared and used within the correct scope, avoiding errors in dynamic SQL execution.
