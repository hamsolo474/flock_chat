Hereâ€™s a summary of the responses regarding the SQL error related to the variable `@table_name_col`:

1. **Error Identification**: The error occurs because the variable `@table_name_col` is not recognized in the context where it's being used, typically due to scope issues in dynamic SQL.

2. **Correct Declaration**: The variable should be declared before it is used. In the provided solutions, `@table_name_col` is declared correctly, but its usage in dynamic SQL needs to be properly handled.

3. **Cursor Usage**: A cursor is employed to iterate over table names from `WM7HIST.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, and the SQL string is constructed within a loop. The variable must be concatenated correctly into the SQL string.

4. **Revised Code Suggestions**:
   - Ensure `@table_name_col` is declared before the cursor loop and used correctly in the dynamic SQL.
   - Use `QUOTENAME` to safely include the variable in the SQL string, preventing SQL injection.
   - Consider executing the dynamic SQL within the loop to maintain scope.

5. **Additional Considerations**: 
   - Ensure database accessibility and permissions for the insert operation.
   - Be cautious of SQL injection vulnerabilities and consider using parameterized queries for better security.

Overall, the key takeaway is to ensure that the variable is properly declared and used within the correct scope to avoid errors in dynamic SQL execution.
