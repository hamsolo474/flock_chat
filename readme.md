Ths is based on DuckGPT, you populate a file called prompt.txt then it uses the DuckDuckGo AI interface to prompt all of their models to respond to your prompt. It saves each response in markdown and summarises them.

It supports UTF8 prompting, so it supports non english language interactions, however i have only tested it in English and Chinese.
